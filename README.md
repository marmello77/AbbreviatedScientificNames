## Functionality and origin

This is a very simple, custom-made R function to abbreviate scientific names. We wrote it to produce short codes to be used in figures, especially graphs representing interaction networks.


## List of folders and files

1. AbbreviatedNames.R -> customized R function to abbreviate scientific names.

2. names.csv -> example data set. This is the list of species studied by [Genrich et al. (2017, Oikos)](https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.03825).

3. names.R -> R script to load the example data set and apply the function to it.


## Instructions

1. Run the script "names.R";

2. Follow the instructions provided in the script;

3. Check the result.
